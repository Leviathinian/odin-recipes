        <h2>Steps to Cook Lasagna:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the meat sauce: In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onion and sauté until soft. Stir in minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Add ground beef or sausage, breaking it apart as it browns. Drain excess fat if needed.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and seasonings: Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Add water if needed to thin the sauce. Simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing flavors to develop.</li>
            <li>Prepare the cheese mixture: In a bowl, mix ricotta (or cottage cheese), shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, egg, salt, and pepper. Stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta: Boil lasagna noodles according to package instructions, then drain and lay them flat to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Layer the lasagna: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce. Add a layer of cooked lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers until you've used all the ingredients, finishing with a final layer of noodles and a generous sprinkle of shredded mozzarella on top.</li>
            <li>Bake: Cover with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for about 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 10-15 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let it rest: Allow the lasagna to cool for about 10 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set.</li>
        </ol>
